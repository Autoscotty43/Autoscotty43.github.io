    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Jared Scott, a software developer with experience in Database construction, Web development,
      Android development, And many more! I am currently working on many projects including: NLP Chatbot, Deep Learning
      Ai, and Windows based apps. Check out projects page for more information on my current projects!
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in programming started at Nova Scotia Community College, where I honed my skills in building
      real-world applications. I grew a fond love for coding through NSCC. I am passionate about problem-solving and
      developing user-friendly applications. I have also become very interested in creating Ai projects that benefit the world!

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me balance work and life. Crafting is one
          hobby I deeply enjoy, whether it's creating something new or just relaxing with a creative project.
          I also enjoy working out to keep myself healthy and energized. And of course, I love food â€“ trying new dishes
          is always an exciting experience for me. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology, and I'm currently immersed in the world of AI. I'm
          building NLP chatbots that can hold engaging conversations and developing deep learning models that can
          accurately classify plant species. But my interests extend beyond the digital realm. I find immense
          satisfaction in crafting beautiful and functional objects from wood, whether it's a sturdy table or a
          comfortable chair.  My love for gaming provides the perfect escape, allowing me to explore new worlds
          and challenges. In the kitchen, I'm a culinary enthusiast, always experimenting with new flavors and recipes. Cooking is my
          way of de-stressing and expressing my creativity. I believe in a balanced lifestyle, so I make sure to
          prioritize my well-being.  You'll often find me at the gym, pushing my limits, or lost in a captivating game.
          I'm always eager to try new things, especially when it comes to food  exploring diverse cuisines is a
          constant adventure for me.
