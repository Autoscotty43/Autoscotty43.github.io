          Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me balance work and life. I'm an avid gamer,
          always keeping up with the latest games. Crafting is another hobby I deeply enjoy, whether it's creating
          something new or just relaxing with a creative project. I also enjoy working out to keep myself healthy and
          energized. And of course, I love food â€“ trying new dishes is always an exciting experience for me.
